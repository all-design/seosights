Task ID: 2
Agent: Main Agent
Task: Remove white background from logo, integrate 8 AI agents into analysis pipeline

Work Log:
- Used Python Pillow to remove white/near-white pixels from logo (made transparent)
- Read Notion page (JS-rendered, couldn't extract) and claude-seo.md for agent role definitions
- Created /src/lib/agents.ts with 8 specialized agents:
  1. Crawler Agent (Technical SEO audit)
  2. Schema Architect (Structured data, AEO readiness)
  3. Content Analyst (Content quality, humanization, parasite risk)
  4. E-E-A-T Auditor (Trust signals, Who/How/Why test)
  5. GEO Specialist (AI crawler, citability, brand mentions, knowledge graph)
  6. Link Architect (Backlink outreach, AI citation strategy)
  7. Local Scout (Local SEO, GBP, NAP, reviews)
  8. SXO Strategist (Strategy lead: intent, roadmap, KPIs, content briefs, technical implementations)
- Refactored /src/app/api/analyze/route.ts to use 8 agents in 2 parallel batches:
  - Batch 1 (40-60%): Crawler, Schema Architect, Content Analyst, E-E-A-T Auditor
  - Batch 2 (62-82%): GEO Specialist, Link Architect, Local Scout, SXO Strategist
  - Agents run with 1800ms stagger to avoid rate limits
  - Deep merge of all agent results with comprehensive fallbacks
- Updated AnalyzingView with 8 agent phases in progress display
- Updated How It Works section: Step 2 = "8 Agents Analyze", Step 3 = "Auto-Execute Strategy"
- Updated Hero subtitle to mention "8 specialized AI agents"
- Verified logo transparency in browser (no white background)
- Verified all sections render correctly with no errors

Stage Summary:
- Logo now has transparent background
- 8-agent system fully integrated with specialized prompts
- Two-batch parallel execution with rate limit protection
- All agent results deep-merged into compatible SEOAnalysis format
- Browser QA passed with zero errors
